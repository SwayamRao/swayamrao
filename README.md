## About Me

Hi there! I’m Swayam Rao, and I like my cybersecurity like my coffee: strong, dark, and designed to keep you awake at night.

Here’s a bit about me:
- 🛡️ I spend my free time trying to outsmart computers... and occasionally losing.

- 🔓 I can break into systems, but I also know how to lock the door behind me. It’s called ethical hacking, not chaotic hacking.

- 🧠 I'm in the top 1% on TryHackMe, which sounds cool until you realize I’ve spent more time with virtual machines than actual humans.

- 🔧 I use tools like John the Ripper—not to bake, but to crack passwords (don’t worry, only the legal kind).

## Some Facts

- My favorite programming language? The one that works  **¯\_(ツ)_/¯**

- I’ve Googled “How to exit nano” more times than I care to admit.
